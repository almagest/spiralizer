Ruby Test - "The Spiralizer"

Write a Ruby gem that takes a matrix (or two dimensional array) and returns a string.
The matrix may be of arbitrary size and must consist of uppercase English letters.
The returned string must consist of all elements of the matrix ordered in a clockwise
spiral pattern starting with element [0, 0]. Each letter must be converted to lowercase
and separated by a single whitespace character.

For example, given the following matrix:
```
A B C D
E F G H
I J K L
```
The resulting string would be:
"a b c d h l k j i e f g"

Appropriate error message(s) should be displayed if invalid input is provided.
